# Homework 5

[Assignment](https://calvin-data304.netlify.app/hw/hw05-portfolio-start.html)

## Exercise 1

a.
![Graph](https://r-graph-gallery.com/img/fromTheWeb/we-line-chart-consumer-confidence.png){width=70%}

b.
The graphic is made of lines, with x representing time and y an indicator of how much the average consumer feels about the future of the economy (100 is neutral, high is positive low is negative). There is a line for each of 9 chosen countries, and these are distinguished with facets that assign a color to one each.

c.
The stated story is that consumer confidence has fallen across the world in 2022, which it shows well.

d.
I think it's a good graphic because it gives a satisfying amount of detail while still allowing comparisons between countries. The trend for each country is easy to see, and while comparing one country to another is difficult the gray lines make comparing one country to the rest of the "world" easy.

e.
I can absolutely make lines and facets so the core of it I can do. I haven't done layering like this before but that seems simple based on the class slides. I don't know exactly how to make the non trendline layers like the 100 line, point, and label on the right. It shouldn't bee to complicated though once layers are made.

f.
As mentioned I'm not certain how to make the middle line and the text, but I think the slides give enough detail.

## Exercise 2
```{r}
library(vegabrite)
library(dplyr)
weather <- read.csv("https://calvin-data304.netlify.app/data/weather-with-dates.csv")

weather <- weather |> filter(location == "Seattle")
```

### 2.2
```{r}
vl_chart(width = 600, height = 400, title = "Monthly Tempuratures in Seattle") |>
  vl_add_data(weather) |>
  vl_mark_bar() |>
  vl_encode_x("month:O") |>
  vl_encode_y("temp_max:Q") |>
  vl_aggregate_y("mean") |>
  vl_encode_y2("temp_min:Q") |>
  vl_aggregate_y2("mean") |>
  vl_axis_x(title = "Month") |>
  vl_axis_y(title = "Average High and Low Tempurature")
```

### 2.3
```{r}
vl_chart(width = 300, height = 200, title = "Monthly Tempuratures in Seattle") |>
  vl_add_data(weather) |>
  vl_mark_line() |>
  vl_facet("weather", columns = 2) |>
  vl_encode_x("month:O") |>
  vl_encode_y("weather:Q") |>
  vl_aggregate_y("count") |>
  vl_axis_x(title = "Month") |>
  vl_axis_y(title = "# Of Days Over 4 Years")
# The Y axis is bad, not sure how to make it what I want without data wrangling
# I think I want a % of days in that month that are that weather
# The shape should be mostly the same though
```

# Homework 6

[Assignment](https://calvin-data304.netlify.app/hw/hw06-tufte.html)

## Exercise 1

a.
Something very interesting to me that Tufte brings up is in showing time series there are graphics I normally wouldn't think about as representing data. Showing how an animal moves in a series of pictures laid out to show time, or most interesting to me the graphic of the Rhone bridge collapse, which can't even assign time to the x axis and instead overlays a before and after. I don't know how much this will come up given I expect my data to be numeric, but it's a reminder to be creative.

b.
Playfair's chart on wheat prices compared to wages over time (page 34)
![Graph](playfair_graphic.jpg){width=70%}
I chose to look at this graphic because the idea of using 3-4 different marks on one timescale is very interesting. Using a fade-out to not overlap the bars and line is clever and not something I'd consider on a computer.
X is time in year, Y is shillings used for both price and weekly wage, color is used just to distinguish parts.
It's 3 layers, each of which should be simple. However the gradient to add space seems impossible in Vega-Lite, maybe a hackey solution could be made to emulate it but I doubt think anything that smooth is possible.
The point is to give compare how prices and wages have changed over time, adding the current monarch at the top would have given extra historical context to help the reader.

## Exercise 2

a.
The big lesson in this section seemed to be pay attention to the guides, axes should be labeled, consistent, and intuitive. Try to limit to what is relevant.

b.
Always be asking what someone who doesn't know the data or story would see first.

## Exercise 3

Part 1.
  - Having 2 different Y axes both in % is confusing
  - The response rate numbers go over the bars and are hard to read
  - The main point feels hard to understand, I think the point is that responses went up? but I assume completion rate is completion given they responded, so when it goes down it's hard to know if overall there were more or less completed responses (especially with the mismatched scales)
  
Part 2.
  - The Y axis can be made into one line that starts at 0
  - The marks can be arranged differently so text isn't as necessary
  - Make response rate the focus, and put completion rate under response to better show their relationship (I'm assuming that's how they work)

Part 3.
